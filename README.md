## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm an IT professional with almost 2 years of hands-on experience in the tech industry, preceded by a period of intensive self-driven learning and personal projects.
I began my career as a **Software Developer**, focusing on backend development, and for the past year, I've been working as a **Cloud Engineer**, specializing in **DevOps practices**, **infrastructure automation**, and **cloud-native technologies**.

Beyond my professional work, I have a strong interest in **cybersecurity**, **financial markets**, and emerging technologies such as **blockchain**.

An ongoing personal project started in 2024 to explore low-level programming, operating system internals, and common security vulnerabilities in user input handling.
Written primarily in C and assembly, with some initialization scripts. The project is strictly for educational and ethical purposes â€” aimed at deepening my understanding of Windows internals and how malicious software operates and spreads.
